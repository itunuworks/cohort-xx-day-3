## About the project

This project contains **5 Andelabs functions** and a **Front End Project** which in my case, is a cloned Google homepage.

- toTwenty 

  - This function is declared as a prototype of the **Array** Class and would return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ... 20]` when called.

- toForty

  - This function is also declared as a prototype of the **Array** Class and would return `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10 ... 40]` when called.

- toOneThousand

  - This function is also declared as a prototype of the **Array** Class and would return `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50 ... 1000]` when called. 

- search

  - This function is also declared as a prototype of the **Array** Class and takes in one number as argument so that a statement in the form `arr.search(4)` would return the index position of number 4 in that array.
  For example 
  `[2, 3, 4, 8].search(3)` would return `1`
  and 
  `[2, 3, 4, 8].search(12)` would return `-1`

- Google Homepage clone
